# For optimal switch-overs, do the following:
# 1. Drop lifetimes for any DNS records that need to change
# 2. Add incoming to mta-sts.txt; wait for it to deploy, *then* update MTA-STS DNS record
# 3. Add outgoing to DKIM and SPF as dictated by the provider
# 4. Wait the full lifetime of the original records
# 5. Switch over to the new server
# 6. Wait for the new server's usages to propagate
# 7. Remove the old servers from authentication (see above)
# 8. Restore any DNS record lifetimes
